Welcome to our eye tracking data visualization project.

1.) You do not need to worry about the Eclipse/java folder to run our visualization. This java program is used to create the data files which are used by our javascript, to generate the visualization. However, all of the data files themselves are included within the directory of VS-d3 folder.

2.) If you would like to run the java program, you will need to download the .jar for google GSON and set the build path for the project in your IDE.

3.) To run visualization, import VS-d3 folder into Visual Studio Code or your preffered web environment, and open index.html


About Our Project:
  After creating json formatted files to hold all of our desired data, we utilized javascripts D3js library to form interactive visualization of the data.
  
  Our primary goal is to use the data to illustrate the differences in eye movement when viewing information on a tree vs a graph. This also factors in a 'simple' conference ontology, and a 'difficult' biology ontology. This gives us 4 categorizations of data to compare and draw conclusions from.
  
  Our secondary goals are to make the visualization offer a simple interactive user experience, focusing on how we can utilize user interactions to support our primary goal.
  
  Lastly, we wanted to make some attempt to have the visualization aesthetic.
